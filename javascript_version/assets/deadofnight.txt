The sun goes down, another dreamless night
You're right by my side
You wake me up, you say it's time to ride
In the dead of night
Strange canyon road, strange look in your eyes
You shut them as we fly
As we fly

Stark, hollow town, Carson City lights
Baby, let's get high
Spend a Johnny's cash, hitch another ride
We laugh until we cry
You say, "Go fast," I say, "Hold on tight"
In the dead of night
Dead of night

See
See the boys as they walk on by

(By)
As they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
It's enough to make a young man—

Six summers down, another dreamless night
You're not by my side
Scratch on the moon like a familiar smile
Stained on my mind
Some other town, someone else's life
Dead in the night
In the night

See
See the boys as they walk on by
See
See the boys as they walk on by
See
See the boys as they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
(By)
As they walk on by
It's enough to make a young man—

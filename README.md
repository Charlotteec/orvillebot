# orvillebot

Discord bot created for fun. 

## Usage

### Python version

This version stays online and is hosted on a raspberry pi. 

`!sing` can be used to get the bot to print the lyrics to a song from Pony. 

`!ping` replies with "pong". Used for testing. 

### To Use: 

1. Create a textfile called *config.txt*. 
2. Add your token to that textfile. 
3. Run using `python3 orvillebot.py &` to run silently and leave live.
4. To end the process, use command located in turn_off.txt


  #### Upcoming Changes
  * Adding the rest of the songs from his discography to sing
  * Potentially integrate something to play the songs to the server. 

### Javascript version

This version is not online currently. Needs to be made active to work. 

`/sing` can be used to print the lyrics of an Orville Peck song. 

`/test` to test connectivity.

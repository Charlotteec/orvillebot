It's got an awful bite
It's gonna rise again
Keeping track of everything we lose
Another whole demand

Tell me you can stay

Don't leave, don't cry
You're just another boy caught in the rye
Don't say goodbye
Head full of nothing and I'm wondering why

It's alright
Yeah it's alright
It's alright

I'm coming down
I got your life laid on my floor
Yeah I'm something of a liar now
'Cause I've seen it all before

Tell me you can't wait

Don't leave, don't cry
You're just another boy caught in the rye
Don't say goodbye
Head full of nothing and I'm wondering why

It's alright
Yeah it's alright
It's alright
Yeehaw

Tell me you can stay

Don't leave, don't cry
You're just another boy caught in the rye
Don't say goodbye
Head full of nothing and I'm wondering why

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright

Walking out towards the gate
You'll all be stars, now just you wait
Done enough to take the bait
Don't let my sorrow turn to hate
Turn to hate
Turn to hate
Turn to hate
Turn to hate
Turn to hate

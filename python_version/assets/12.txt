Some men only ride alone
I only ride in the night
Some drown in the warmth of home
But nothing fades like the light

Blackened houses, morning skies on my mind
April showers, June is the same in your eyes
Something tells me, you know why I lie
But nothing fades like the light

Time goes by I wanna rise up
And I know why things change
And I know why I stay the same

Some say I should learn to cry
But I only learned how to fight
And I know everything must die
But nothing fades like the light
No, nothing fades like the light

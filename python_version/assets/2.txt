Had a lover but I lost my patience
Gonna get a song on a radio station
Got a fire but you just can't use it
I don't mean no lies, baby, please don't lose it

Lost my way on the other side
I know why, I don't know when
From the way that we said goodbye
I knew I'd never see you again

Left my mind in the Salt Lake City
Met a lot of men who would call me pretty
Pack of reds, watch the dames get colder
Don't it make you cry, how we're getting older?

Lost my way on the other side
I know why, I don't know when
From the way that we said goodbye
I knew I'd never see you again

Ride, ride the wind
Ride, ride the wind
Ride, ride
Ride, ride
Ride, ride the wind
Ride, ride the wind
Ride, ride the wind
Ride, ride the wind

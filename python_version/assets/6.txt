Come and lay down your shoulder
Tomorrow isn't that far
And if we don't get older
Just know you were always my star

They said, "Why, oh, why did you do it?"
But if I die (But if I die), don't you cry
Because Kansas remembers me now
(Kansas remembers, Kansas remembers)
Kansas remembers me now

Come, last leg of sunset
Nothing left to hide (Nothing left to hide)
Brother's gone, do I regret it?
Not a thing, now that Dick's by my side

They said, "Why, oh, why did you do it?"
But if I die, don't you cry
Because Kansas remembers me now
(Kansas remembers, Kansas remembers)
Kansas remembers me now

Kansas remembers me now

Hitch a ride on my makeup
I consider it another man's problem
Yeah, head on, ride
Strike gold on my eyelids
Got a sister who knows nothing but violence
Yeah, head on, ride

Hitch a ride on my violence
Bring fear, got a fever in silence
Yeah, head on, ride

I caught you staring at the sun
Looking out for number one
Yeah, head on, ride
I saw the tail on your lips
Another truth for my fists
Yeah, head on, ride

Strike time on my target
Pull the leather, tug the rosary on it
Yeah, head on, ride
Rawhide on your polish
Strike a match, need a lick and a promise
Yeah, head on, ride

I caught you staring at the sun
Looking out for number one
Yeah, head on, ride
I saw the tail on your lips
Another truth for my fists
Yeah, head on, ride

Saw the buffalo run
Run (Run, run, run)
Run (Run, run, run)
Run (Run, run, run)

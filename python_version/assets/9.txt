Back on the run, back to the blue
Winning is fun, losing is, too
Roses are fallin', roses from fallin' for you, ooh

The ache inside the hate
I found a way to sit and wait
And now I can't, your voice, your face
Without a trace, I'll wait for you
Roses are fallin' for you, you

Under your skin, over the moon
Don't let me in, I don't know what I'd do
Roses are fallin', roses from fallin' for you, ooh

You know darling, you bring out the worst in me
Sometimes, when I'm around you, I feel like pure evil
I guess they say nobody's perfect
But they've never met a devil like you

Oh, roses are fallin' for you
Roses are fallin' for you
Roses are fallin' for you

Gone was the way we were
Just like the days we'd burn
Everything 'round us would burn

Take me back to the time
I was yours and you were mine
Take me back, the words I'd say
I had to whisper
Because you liked it that way

I'm still undone, not quite young
But I, I still try
Cross my heart, now I hope to die

Was the way we were
Just like you'd say, we'd turn?
Everything 'round us, big burn

Take me back to the time
I was yours and you were mine
Take me back to the world I know
You were crying
They don't cry when we're gone

I'm still undone, not quite young
But I, I still try
Cross my heart, now I hope to

And I'm still undone, I'm not quite young
But I, I still try
Cross my heart, now I hope to die
Cross my heart, now I hope to die

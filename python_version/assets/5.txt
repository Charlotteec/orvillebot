Sneak heroine, just a man
Slow on the draw
Velvet gloves, you still a stunner
Don't be down, girl, this world is a bummer

Queen of the rodeo
You rode on in with nowhere else to go
You know the tune so the words don't matter
Beyond this town lies a life much sadder
Babe, I know
Another evening to show
Queen of the rodeo

Sweet Marilyn, satin gown
Hard to ignore
Stary-eyed, a little younger
The night is long, your days are numbered

Queen of the rodeo
You're ridden out with nowhere else to go
You know the tune so the words don't matter
Beyond this town lies a life much sadder
Babe, I know
Another evening to show

I see you around
Still around
Still around
Steal the crown

Sneak heroine, just a man
Slow on the draw
They play your song, is it another?
Don't be down, girl, this world is a bummer

Queen of the rodeo
You rode on in with nowhere else to go
You know the tune so the words don't matter
Beyond this town lies a life much sadder
Babe, I know
Another evening to show
Queen of the rodeo

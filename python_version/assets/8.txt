Fell in love with a rider
Dirt king, black crown
Six months on a knucklehead hog
I like him best when he's not around
He gets me high, ooh, big sky

Fell in love with a boxer
Stayed awake all year
Heartbreak is a warm sensation
When the only feeling that you know is fear
I don’t know why, oh, big sky

Big sky, big sky
I don't know why
Oh, big sky

Fell in love with a jailer
Cabin at Fort Quay
Her and me and the baby made three
Visit once in a while when I'm not at sea
She keeps me dry, oh, big sky

Big sky, big sky
I don’t know why
Oh, big sky

Big sky, big sky
Big sky, big sky

Hear them riding, baby
Hear them coming around my door (Oh no)
Light's been out, though, baby
And I've been long, long gone (Yeehaw)
I'm keen to play with fire, but now I'm not so sure

Racing down the road that I've been before
I've seen rattlesnakes behind every door
I've been around this world and now everything's a bore
I don't know that much, but I know about keeping score
And if there's one thing I know for sure
It'd be a long cold day in Hell when I take you back

Can you hear the horses, baby?
Stronger than an iron hoof
But this town has always bored me
And baby, that's including you

Racing down the road that I've been before
I've seen rattlesnakes behind every door
I've been around this world and it's rotten to the core
Yeah, I don't know that much, but I know about keeping score
I got a face of gold, I got a heart of coal
But baby, that's my cross to bear
I won't take you back

I won't take you back
I won't take you back
I won't take you back
I won't take you back
I won't take you back
I won't take you back

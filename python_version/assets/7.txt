Old river, tumble down
Poor Moore sister broke her crown
Still, there's snow left on the ground
Old river tumblin' down
Old river, tumble down
Big wind blowin' all around
Each small bullet makes a sound
Old river tumblin' down

Tumblin' down, tumblin' down
Tumblin' down, tumblin' down
Tumblin' down, tumblin' down
